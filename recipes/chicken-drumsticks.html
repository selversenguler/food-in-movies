<h2>Instructions</h2>
<strong>Prep the oven and pan.</strong> Preheat the oven. Line a baking sheet with foil and place an oven safe rack over the sheet pan.
<br><strong>Dry the chicken.</strong> Pat the drumsticks with a paper towel, which will help get rid of any extra moisture and get them nice and crispy.
<br><strong>Brush with butter.</strong> Brush the chicken legs on all sides with melted butter, or drizzle with olive oil or avocado oil if you prefer.
<br><strong>Season the drumsticks.</strong> Sprinkle on the smoked paprika, garlic powder, sea salt, and black pepper.
<br><strong>Bake.</strong> Cooking chicken legs at high heat will get them crispy, just how we want them. Roast at high heat, the best baked chicken legs oven temp is fairly high (425 degrees F), which helps crisp up the skin. Bake 35-45 minutes.
<br><strong>Rest.</strong> Let the baked chicken drumsticks rest for 5 minutes before serving, which helps seal in the juices and ensure that they stay moist on the inside.
